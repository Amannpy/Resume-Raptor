## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amannpy/Resume-Raptor.git
cd Resume-Raptor
2. Install Dependencies
Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment.

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Add API Keys
Create a .env file inside the utils/ directory with the following contents:

env
Copy
Edit
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
The .env file is used to securely load environment variables. It is excluded from version control via .gitignore.

Make sure your code uses load_dotenv(dotenv_path='utils/.env') to load it correctly.

Deployment on Streamlit Cloud
If deploying to Streamlit Cloud, manually add your secrets in the Streamlit Secrets Manager.

Use the following TOML format:

toml
Copy
Edit
[secrets]
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your_google_gemini_api_key"
OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "your_openrouter_api_key"
These are automatically injected as environment variables at runtime. You do not need a .env file during deployment.
